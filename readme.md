# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy. Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations, code, and usage examples.

## Motivation

As an early professional, I embarked on the journey of implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch for several reasons:

- **Deep Understanding**: Implementing algorithms from scratch provides a deep understanding of how they work under the hood. It allows me to grasp the core principles and mathematical foundations behind machine learning.

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Writing algorithms from scratch hones my problem-solving skills. I've had to address various challenges and optimize code for performance and accuracy.

- **Customization**: Implementing algorithms from scratch allows for customization. I can fine-tune the models to fit specific use cases and experiment with variations and enhancements.

- **Educational Resource**: This repository serves as an educational resource for others who want to learn about machine learning. It provides clear explanations and practical examples to demystify complex concepts.

- **Contributions to the Community**: By sharing these implementations, I hope to contribute to the machine learning community. Others can benefit from the code and insights I've gained so far.
