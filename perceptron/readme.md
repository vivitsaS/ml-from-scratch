Perceptron is similar to regression models, except it does not use
gradient descent and it updates based on true difference between
true and predicted vectors, scaled by feature vectors and moderated in a similar fashion using learning rate.
It's a binary classifier, so the y_predicted and y_true vectors have binary values. It is a very basic algorithm for classification but these stacked together can perform useful computations. These arrangements form the basic backbone of neural networks.
