## Algorithm Fundamentals

k-NN is a non-parametric and instance-based machine learning algorithm. Key concepts include:

- Euclidean Distance: Measuring the similarity between data points.
- Majority Vote: Classifying new data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.

KNN is a simple yet powerful concept that relies on the proximity of data points in a feature space to make predictions. It's versatile and easy to understand, making it a valuable tool in various machine learning tasks, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets with clear patterns. However, it has limitations, such as computational efficiency in high-dimensional spaces and sensitivity to noisy data.
The prediction for a given (x,y) is the most commonly occuring result- falling in k unit radius around the point (x,y) the chosen average euclidaen distance = k

## Implementation Details

The script defines a `KNN` class with the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the k-NN model with a user-defined value of `k`, which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider during classification.
- `fit`: Fits the k-NN model to the training data, storing the training dataset and its labels.
- `predict`: Makes predictions for a set of input data using the k-NN algorithm. For each data point, it computes the Euclidean distances to all training data points, identifies the k-nearest neighbors, and performs a majority vote to determine the predicted class.

## How to Use

1. Import the script and create an instance of the `KNN` class, specifying the number of neighbors `k`.
2. Prepare your data as NumPy arrays, where `X` represents the features, and `y` is the corresponding class labels.
3. Use the `fit` method to train the model with your training data.
4. Use the `predict` method to make predictions on new data.
5. Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions to assess the model's performance.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Possible Modifications and Variations

k-NN is a versatile algorithm with various modifications and use cases:

* Distance Metrics: You can use different distance metrics other than Euclidean, such as Manhattan, Minkowski, or customized distance functions.
* Feature Scaling: Applying feature scaling or normalization can improve k-NN's performance when features have different scales.
* Optimizing k: Experiment with different values of k to find the optimal number of neighbors for your specific dataset.
* Weighted k-NN: Weight the influence of neighbors based on their distance, giving closer neighbors more importance.
* Distance-Weighted Voting: Assign different weights to neighbors based on their distance when performing the majority vote.
