KNN is a simple yet powerful concept that relies on the proximity of data points in a feature space to make predictions. It's versatile and easy to understand, making it a valuable tool in various machine learning tasks, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets with clear patterns. However, it has limitations, such as computational efficiency in high-dimensional spaces and sensitivity to noisy data.
The prediction for a given (x,y) is the most commonly occuring result- falling in k unit radius around the point (x,y) the chosen average euclidaen distance = k
